## Overview

### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


**HTML:
- The HTML structure includes a form with various input fields for full name, username, email, phone number, password, and confirm password.
- Gender selection is implemented with radio buttons.
- The form is enclosed in a container with a heading.

**CSS:
- Universal reset and styling are applied using the wildcard selector (`*`).
- The body has a gradient background (`linear-gradient`) with flexbox properties for centering and styling.
- The container has a maximum width, padding, border-radius, and a gradient background with a border and box-shadow for a card-like appearance.
- The heading has a specific font size, weight, and is positioned relative to create an underline effect with a gradient.
- Input fields have a consistent height, border-radius, and transition effect on focus.
- The gender selection has a circular title and styling for radio buttons.
- Buttons have specific padding, margin, height, width, and a gradient background.

**Media Query:
- The layout adjusts for smaller screens using a media query (`@media`).
- Card-box elements become full-width, and circular-form elements take 100% width.
- For smaller screens, a scroll is added to the card-details section.

**Colors:
- Background: Gradient of dark blue (#05073a) to teal (#0ef) and light blue (#71b7e6) to purple (#9b5b).
- Text: White (#fff), with variations in opacity for gradient effects.
- Border: #0ef (teal) and #9b59b6 (purple).
- Input Focus: Border color changes to #9b59b6 on focus.

**Styles:
- Modern card-like design with gradients and subtle shadow.
- Consistent font-family for text.
- Responsive layout for various screen sizes.
- Well-defined form sections and input styling for clarity.
- Underlined heading for a decorative effect.

In summary, the code combines functionality and aesthetics, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly registration form with a responsive design.
